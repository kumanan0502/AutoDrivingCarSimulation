# AutoDrivingCarSimulation

A brief description of your project.

The task involves testing a prototype self-driving car on a rectangular field, using commands to rotate and move the car. The field dimensions, initial position, and facing direction of the car are provided, along with a sequence of commands. The goal is to determine the final position and facing direction of the car after executing the commands, considering boundary constraints.

For example, given a field of size 10 by 10, a car initially at (1,2) facing North, and the command sequence "FFRFFFRRLF," the expected output is the final position and facing direction, such as "4 3 S." This output indicates that the car ends up at position (4,3) facing South.
